    "text": "The idea of synthetic data has first been proposed independently by Donald B. Rubin and Roderick J.A. Little, who you may know as members of the founding fathers of modern missing data theory in 1993 [(rubin?); (little?); TODO: FIX REFS]. Both proposed, albeit in slightly different ways, to not release the original data, but replace values from the original data with values drawn from some model. That is, synthetic data is nothing more than generated data, and is occasionally called simulated data, digital twins or even fake data. This model can be specified independent of the data at hand, but typically it is estimated on a data set. Moreover, the model can range from very simple (e.g., a set of values with attached probabilities) to extremely complex (e.g., a neural network with billions of parameters). Whatever model is used, it is essential that new samples can be generated from it.\nIn what follows, we assume that there is a observed data set, \\(X\\), consisting of \\(n\\) observations measured on \\(p\\) variables. Furthermore, we assume that these observations adhere to some structure that we can encode in the joint distribution of the variables, \\(f(X)\\). If we would know this distribution, we could sample new observations from it directly, but we typically do not know this. However, we can estimate this joint distribution, leading to \\(\\hat{f}(X)\\), and sample new observations from this."

Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.\nUsing Creative Commons Public Licenses\nCreative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\nConsiderations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.\nConsiderations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.\n\n\n\nBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (“Public License”). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\n\nAdapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\nAdapter’s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nBY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.\nCopyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\nEffective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\nExceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\nLicense Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution and ShareAlike.\nLicensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\nLicensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\nLicensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\nShare means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\nSui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\nYou means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\nLicense grant.\n\nSubject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\nA. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\nB. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\nExceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\nTerm. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\nMedia and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\nDownstream recipients.\nA. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nB. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.\nC. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\nNo endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\nOther rights.\n\nMoral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\nPatent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\nAttribution.\n\nIf You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\nA. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n\nidentification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\na copyright notice;\na notice that refers to this Public License;\na notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\na URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n\nB. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\nC. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\nYou may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\nIf requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\nShareAlike.\n\nIn addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n\nThe Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\nYou must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter’s License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.\nYou may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter’s License You apply.\n\n\n\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\nfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\nif You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\nYou must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\n\n\nUnless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\nTo the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

    "text": "Tutorial Overview\nThis self-paced tutorial will introduce you to the generation and evaluation of synthetic data. Synthetic data is generated data that can be used as an alternative to privacy-sensitive data, for example to enhance open science practices. The tutorial is intended to take approximately 4 hours to complete.\nThe tutorial is split into the following sections:\n\nStatistical Disclosure Control provides a very brief introduction to statistical disclosure control.\nSynthetic data: The general idea conceptually introduces the idea of synthetic data and contains an optional section on coding your own simple synthesizer.\nGenerating synthetic data introduces the idea of synthetic data and outlines how it can be generated in R.\nEvaluating synthetic data quality addresses the privacy-utility trade-off, and discusses how the quality of synthetic data can be evaluated from both sides of this trade-off.\n\nAt the end of this tutorial, you will now what synthetic data is and why it is useful, have experience with generating synthetic data, and know how to think about whether the data is fit for release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Software\n\n\n\nThis tutorial assumes you have the following software installed:\n\nA recent version of R (&gt;= 4.1.0)\nRStudio\n\nAlso, the tutorial requires the following R packages:\n\nsynthpop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "title": "Generating synthetic data in R using synthpop",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Now that we understand the concept of synthetic data and know about the dangers and potential, it is time to actually generate synthetic data in R. Throughout, we will use the synthpop package (Nowok, Raab, and Dibben 2016), which is a powerful tool explicitly designed to generate synthetic data. Other alternatives to create synthetic data are, for example, the R-package mice (van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2011; Volker and Vink 2021) or the stand-alone software IVEware (Raghunathan, Solenberger, and Van Hoewyk 2002).\n\n\nData\nThroughout the practical, we will continue with the boys data from the mice package that we also used in the previous section. Note that you cannot simply load the data from the mice package, because the missing values are imputed to simplify the practical. You can download the data as follows:\n\ndata &lt;- readRDS(\n    url(\"https://github.com/lmu-osc/synthetic-data-tutorial/raw/refs/heads/main/data/boys.RDS\")\n)\n\nThe boys data contains measurements on 9 variables on 748 Dutch boys. The variables in the data are described in the block below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the boys data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nage: Decimal age (0-21 years)\nhgt: Height (cm)\nwgt: Weight (kg)\nbmi: Body mass index\nhc: Head circumference (cm)\ngen: Genital Tanner stage (G1-G5)\nphb: Pubic hair (Tanner P1-P6)\ntv: Testicular volume (ml)\nreg: Region (north, east, west, south, city)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading the required packages\nIn this workshop, you will (at least) use the packages synthpop (Nowok, Raab, and Dibben 2016), densityratio (Volker, Gonzalez Poses, and van Kesteren 2024), ggplot2 (Wickham 2016), patchwork (Pedersen 2024) and purrr (Wickham and Henry 2025). Make sure to load all of the required packages, and in case you haven’t installed them already, install them first, using install.packages(\"package_name\").\n\n1. Install the R-packages synthpop, densityratio, ggplot2, patchwork and purrr from CRAN, and load these packages using library().\n\n\nShow code: Installing required packages\ninstall.packages(\"synthpop\")\ninstall.packages(\"densityratio\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\ninstall.packages(\"patchwork\")\ninstall.packages(\"purrr\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\n\n\nShow code: Loading required packages\nlibrary(synthpop)\nlibrary(densityratio)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting to know the data\n\nNormally, this step would be redundant, as you probably analyzed the data of interest already and know all the ins and outs. However, if the boys data is new for you, it is helpful to invest some time in getting to know the data you will be working with. When creating synthetic data, it eases the modelling procedure when you know what variables there are in the data, and which kinds of relationships you can expect.\n\n2. Inspect the first few rows of the data using head().\n\n\nShow code: Inspect first few rows\nhead(data)\n\n\n\n3. Use the summary() function to get an overview of the data.\n\n\n\nShow code: Inspect first few rows\nsummary(data)\n\n\nYou may notice a couple of things. First, the data seems to be sorted on age. You may verify this by running !is.unsorted(data$age). Second, you may notice that most variables are non-negative, which might be something you want to take into account when modelling the data (but perhaps, this is not so relevant for the analysis at hand; for now, we assume it is). Third, you may notice that the variables hgt, wgt and bmi yield a deterministic system when considered simultaneously. That is, the values for bmi should be consistent with the respective values of hgt and wgt. This is also we want to take into account when modelling the data. Finally, the data consists of a mix of continuous and categorical variables, which allows to model variables of both types.\n\n\n\nCreating synthetic data\n\nWe will continue creating synthetic data with a relatively simple, parametric, synthesis model. To this end, we need to decide on a parametric model to synthesize each variable. Using synthpop, this is a piece of cake, as it allows to specify method = \"parametric\", which selects a parametric model that matches the variable type of the variable at hand. This implies that continuous variables are synthesized using a linear model that preserves the marginal distribution even in the case of non-normality using a nifty transformation of the data. Categorical variables with two categories are synthesized with a logistic regression model and categorical variables with more than two categories are synthesized using ordered or unordered polytomous regression, depending on whether the categories are ordered or not, respectively.\n\n4. Use synthpop() to create a synthetic data set in an object called syn_param using method = \"parametric\". Use seed = 123 if you want to replicate our results.\n\n\n\nShow code: Generating synthetic data with parametric models\nsyn_param &lt;- syn(\n    data = data,\n    method = \"parametric\",\n    seed = 123\n)\n\n\n\nSynthesis\n-----------\n age hgt wgt bmi hc gen phb tv reg\n\n\n\n5. Inspect the syn_param object, what do you see?\n\n\nShow code and context of the model object\nsyn_param\n\n# Calling syn_param shows you some important features of the synthesis \n# procedure. First, it shows the number of synthetic data sets that were \n# generated (syn_param$m). Also, it shows for every variable the method \n# that was used to synthesize the data (syn_param$method). If you want to \n# know more about a specific synthesis method, for example, logreg, you \n# can call ?syn.logreg to get more information.\n\n\n\nIf all is well, all continuous variables are strictly positive, which is due to the transformation synthpop performs when modelling the continuous variables. However, there is a problem that you might have noticed. The variable bmi is not equal to wgt / (hgt/100)^2. This issue can be fixed using passive synthesis.\n\n\nSpecifying custom synthesis models\nIn synthpop, the synthesis method can be altered using the method argument. The method-vector is a vector that contains, for every variable, the imputation method or passive imputation equation with which this variable should be imputed. We can obtain the method-vector that we previously specified implicitly by extracting it from the syn_param object.\n\nmethod &lt;- syn_param$method\nmethod\n\n       age        hgt        wgt        bmi         hc        gen        phb \n  \"sample\" \"normrank\" \"normrank\" \"normrank\" \"normrank\"     \"polr\"     \"polr\" \n        tv        reg \n\"normrank\"  \"polyreg\" \n\n\nWe can alter the synthesis model for any variable by changing the corresponding element in this vector. For passive imputation, we can define a function using ~I(equation). For bmi, this entails the following.\n\nmethod[\"bmi\"] &lt;- \"~I(wgt/(hgt/100)^2)\"\nmethod\n\n                  age                   hgt                   wgt \n             \"sample\"            \"normrank\"            \"normrank\" \n                  bmi                    hc                   gen \n\"~I(wgt/(hgt/100)^2)\"            \"normrank\"                \"polr\" \n                  phb                    tv                   reg \n               \"polr\"            \"normrank\"             \"polyreg\" \n\n\nWith this specification, synthpop knows that it should not use an imputation model, but rather use the synthetic hgt and wgt values to construct the bmi values deterministically.\n6. Use synthpop() to create a synthetic data set in an object called syn_passive using the adjusted method vector. Again, use seed = 123 if you want to replicate our results. Inspect the output.\n\n\nShow code: Synthesize with passive synthesis\nsyn_passive &lt;- syn(\n    data = data,\n    method = method,\n    seed = 123,\n    print = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\nVariable(s) bmi with passive synthesis: relationship does not hold in data.\nTotal of 723 case(s) where predictors do not give value present in data.\nYou might want to recompute the variable(s) in the original data.\n\n\n\n\nShow code: Passive model object\nsyn_passive\n\n\nThe bmi values correspond to the synthetic hgt and wgt values, as we wanted. Using this approach, you can also specify different synthesis methods in general, for example to synthesize some of the variables with a random forest model, or to transform some of the variables before synthesizing them. We will consider this at a later point.\nThe previous exercises showed that generating synthetic data can be quite easy. However, depending on the data at hand, it can become more involved. For example, there might be a hierarchical structure in the data that you want to preserve, for example because observations are nested within groups, or because the data is longitudinal. Modelling such instances might require specialized software, but using fully conditional specification, you can actually stitch multiple models together, one variable at a time, to model the joint distribution of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nNowok, Beata, Gillian M.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nCollected research data often contains sensitive information about individuals. For example, social scientists might collect data on income or criminal behavior, and health data often contains medical information of individuals. Such private information may harm the people involved if disclosed to the public. Even if no harm is incurred, the trust of individuals in the data collector, or scientific institutions in general, may be damaged if such data is revealed. At the same time, broad data availability is very valuable to researchers and governmental institutions alike. Using previously collected data, researchers may answer novel research questions and governmental institutions may improve policy. In addition to these high-level applications, open data can also be used to evaluate the reproducibility of research projects or serve as realistic data in education. That is, open data is valuable for many applications, but simply releasing the data is often not an option.\nThe first step in the process of releasing data is to anonymize it [TODO: see Data Anonymization tutorial]. Anonymization requires that potentially identifying information is removed from the collected data. Examples of such identifying information are names, addresses, IP-addresses, that can often be removed without losing important information. However, after de-identifying the data, your data might still contain information that can lead to indirect identification of individuals, for example because the data can be linked to external data sources. Especially in today’s age of massive data collection, data sources can be linked in surprising ways. For example, in 2006, researchers from the University of Texas were able to uncover the identity of Netflix users by linking Netflix movie reviews to the IMDB database. This might not be a problem for most users, but for some it would yield a high risk of disclosing their sexual orientation. To prevent indirect identification, statistical disclosure control can be applied to the data.\n\n\nStatistical disclosure control\nThe goal of statistical disclosure control is to release a data set that is as similar as possible to the original data, while at the same time ensuring that no individual can be identified from the released data, nor any sensitive information can be inferred (Hundepool et al. 2024). Disclosure is here defined as the release of information about an individual that would not have become public if the data would be kept private. Two types of disclosure risk are commonly considered. First, re-identification disclosure concerns when individuals can be singled out from the released data, resulting in confidential data being leaked. Second, attribute disclosure occurs when some characteristic of an individual can be learned with (near) certainty from the data release. For example, if a release discloses that all inhabitants of a street in some city are on welfare, knowing that a person lives in this street discloses information on their welfare status. Every data release requires that these types of disclosure risk are sufficiently small.\nAt the same time, the goal of a data release is to allow others to do something useful with the released data, and for this purpose, the released data should be similar to the original data. Similarity, in this context, means that the released, but protected, data can be used for the same purposes as the original data. To a reasonable degree, analyses on the released data should yield results similar to results obtained from the original data. Similarity does not mean that the released records are similar to the original records, but rather that over the whole, the distribution of the observed and released data is similar. Statistical disclosure control often yields a trade-off between privacy and utility: the stricter the data protection, the better the privacy of respondents is protected, but the more information is lost, and the lower the utility of the data. The level of protection required depends on the data at hand: data from an insensitive experiment with only very general personal information may require very little protection, while an extensive survey on criminal behavior or sensitive issues should typically be well-protected. At the same time, the level of utility required depends on the problem at hand: if the released data should allow to replicate complex analyses to a reasonable degree of accuracy, more sophisticated disclosure methods are required than when solely some marginal quantities (e.g., means and standard deviations) should be preserved. Note that the privacy-utility trade-off is very much relative: a released data set can be very useful for some purposes, but almost useless for others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The privacy-utility trade-off: one can typically attain either high privacy or high utility, but not both at the same time. Typically, there can be substantial utility of the synthetic data, but some privacy risk will remain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConventional statistical disclosure control methods\nIn practice, many techniques for statistical disclosure control for microdata (that is, data on individual observations, potentially measured at multiple locations, in contrast to tables with aggregated data) have been developed over the years. Typically, these techniques introduce both bias and variance to the data to limit disclosure (Fienberg and Slavković 2011). Common methods that have traditionally been used for statistical disclosure control are (e.g., Reiter 2011; Hundepool et al. 2024):\n\nTODO: ADD REFERENCES\nAggregation: collapsing categories into larger overarching categories (e.g., towns into municipalities or regions, divisions into companies).\nRounding: replacing original values with their rounded counterpart (e.g., income in thousands of euros, age in years).\nTop coding: cap all values higher or lower than some threshold to this threshold (sometimes, only relatively extreme values, such as very large income values, yield a high risk of disclosure).\nMicroaggregation: combine observations into groups of some size where people within a group are maximally similar, calculate the group mean for each variable used to form groups, and replace values on these variables by the respective group mean.\nSuppression: remove sensitive or identifying values from the released data directly (this can even be an entire variable).\nAdding noise: random noise is added to the observed values, such that the released value is different from the underlying observed value.\n\nWhile it is possible for the above approaches to take relationships between variables into account, this is not so common. While these approaches can do a reasonable job in protecting disclosure, they also typically distort data quality tremendously. These approaches are often applied on a variably by variable basis, distorting relationships between variables. Synthetic data is one way to deal with this, as it attempts to model the joint distribution of the variables in the data, and thus allows to capture relationships between variables (at least theoretically). The idea of synthetic data will be more thoroughly explained in the subsequent section.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nFienberg, Stephen E., and Aleksandra B.
